# About

SocialiteProviders is a collection of OAuth 1 &amp; 2 packages that extend <a href="https://github.com/laravel/socialite">Laravel Socialite</a>.

The <i>Observer Pattern</i> is used by the <a href="https://github.com/SocialiteProviders/Manager">Manager</a>
package to extend <a href="https://github.com/laravel/socialite">Socialite</a>.  This allows numerous providers to be used
in addition to the ones provided by <a href="https://github.com/laravel/socialite">Laravel Socialite</a>
(they can be overridden easily).  Only the providers that you add to the listeners array will be used.

Providers have been created by a wide range of people, and the specific creator is mentioned on the website for each provider.

Providers are mostly maintained by <a href="https://atymic.dev">@atymic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lucasmichot">@lucasmichot</a>.
